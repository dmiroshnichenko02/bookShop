              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                Founded in 2023, BookShelf has been serving the
                community with a carefully curated selection of books that spans
                various genres and interests. Our journey began with a simple
                idea: to create a haven for book enthusiasts and provide a
                welcoming space for everyone, from avid readers to those just
                starting their reading adventure.
